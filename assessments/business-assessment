This project contains my analysis for a Junior Business Analyst assessment. The task involved selecting employees for an upcoming project using a dataset with details like project count, project type, and accuracy per project type. I used Excel for basic data cleaning and Tableau for visual analysis to support decision-making.While I passed the HR interview and the assessment, I wasn't selected due to geographical constraints. Still, the project was a great learning experience and enjoyable to work on.
